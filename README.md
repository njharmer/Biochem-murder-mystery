Code to make a murder mystery for year two biochemistry students

This code is written in R v4.2.1. The code requires the tidyverse, rcartocolor, elliptic, and kableextra packages.
Each main script contains code to install these dependencies, hashed out in the current code.
The code should be used with the RStudio IDE. This provides another package, pandoc, that is required for markdown.
Common repositories do not have a suitably up to date version of pandoc, but it is built into RStudio.

To run the code it is most sensible to download the "R" folder. This has all files and folders in a sensible directory structure.

The user should modify the "setwd" command in line 16 to point to the main "R" directory. This is required for the script to 
be aware of where the subfolders for output and for finding subroutines are.

The code accompanies a publication in the Journal of Chemical Education.
The title is: A Murder Mystery gamification session to consolidate analytical biochemical techniques learning
